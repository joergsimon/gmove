gmove
=====

a super simple git tag switcher for presentations.

First of all, gmove is almost to small to bother a githubb repo for it. But I thought some might want to modify it, so why not...

gmove is basically a tool used to switch between git tags while stashing the changes you made while you are in detached state after checking out a tag.

The original indention of the author is for code demos, but feel free do use it for whatever you want.

For how to use it for code demos, see the original blog post here: blog.jsimon.at
